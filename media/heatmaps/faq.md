# How to interpret the heatmaps

The heatmap shows all syllables of the ode, with each syllable colored according to how high it scores at a metric called "melodic compatibility", which can be at the most 1, and at the least 1/2 (or slighly more[^1]).

Put simply, a compatibility score of 1 means that if Pindar had wanted to compose a melody that satisfied both the following conditions, he could have: 

1. perfectly matched the natural melody of the pitch accents of the language and
2. moved up or down (i.e. didn't repeat the pitch of the note setting the previous syllable).

The lower the score, the less the melody (i.e. any melody!) would have accomodated the pitch accents. Specifically, the score gives the portion of strophes in which the melody rose as the pitch accent fell, or vice versa, so that a score of, say, 8/13 means that no matter whether Pindar decided to let the melody rise or fall while singing this syllable, his melody would contradict the prosody of at least five strophes. 

Importantly, it is perfectly possible to know the above hypothetical or conditional fact about melodic constraints regardless of whether Pindar *actually* did or even would have wanted to compose such a melody, something we will never know, barring the unlikely discovery of a Pindaric musical papyrus or inscription. 

# So what?



[^1]: If the number of strophes is uneven, the lowest score is the smallest majority share, i.e. if there are 13 strophes, the lowest score is 7/13. 
# The texts

It would be vain to look at the heatmaps without reading the actual odes. If the `text overlay` option above is not enough, all Pindar's odes are available in a readable format with the metre marked at David Chamberlain's excellent website [Hypotactic](https://hypotactic.com/latin/index.html?Use_Id=olympians). For those without knowledge of Greek, parallell English translations can be found at the [Perseus website](https://scaife.perseus.org/library/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0033/), with the caveat that the syllables of the English translations do not (of course) stand in a one-to-one relationship with the Greek syllables, and cannot help decide the meaning at a certain position in the heatmap. For that, the reader would have to consult the relevant entry in the [Liddle and Scott online dictionary](https://logeion.uchicago.edu/%E1%BC%84%CF%81%CE%B9%CF%83%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%82)
