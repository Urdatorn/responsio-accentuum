Software to measure virtual constraints on melody and accentual responsion in Greek polystrophic lyric, mainly Pindar. This project builds on and generalizes my previous work on the songs of Aristophanes, found [here](https://github.com/Urdatorn/aristophanis-cantica).

# TODO 

- *Make barys and acute-circumflex responsions non-binary as well, so can make heat map of a full ode showing degree of responsion tendency.*
- make Frankenstein null baseline strophes by searching odes for lines with the same lengths as P4, being careful not to include to lines from the same ode in the same line in diff strophes
